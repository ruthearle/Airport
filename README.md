# Airport

####Weekend Challenge (no pairing)

Modelling an airport in Ruby.

This program has Airport and Plane classes, and a Weather module (which is mixed into Airport so it knows what the weather's like). Weather is randomly generated, but tends to be sunny more often than stormy. Testing is done in RSpec.
